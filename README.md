tree command replacement


After compiling, copy tree.exe to your System32 folder. Also, rename the original tree.com file to something like tree_.com (It'll be protected by TrustedInstaller so you'll need to take ownership: https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-7/windows-7-how-to-delete-files-protected-by-trustedinstaller/).

Once that is done, you can set the displayed message by using this command: *tree -m "no wiruses found on this dextop"*
